# StarFinder
This folder contains various different ways to find k number of closest stars to Earth.
findStars uses for loops to iterate through a list and add the stars to a new list of closest stars.
findStars2 uses a comparator class to compare two stars' distance from Earth, sorts the list, and then returns k number of stars closest to Earth.
